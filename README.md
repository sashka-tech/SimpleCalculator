# Hi everyone :wave:

I'm a web developer from the Czech Republic, who loves open source, and is currently working at [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/).
I mainly code in TypeScript, in 2020 I fell in love with Next.js, React, React Native, Svelte and so many other modern web frameworks. I am always learning. Currently I'm also
working on a couple of open-source projects, including my own
[Interclip](https://github.com/interclip/interclip), which is a tool
that can be used to share links across devices. I also am contributing
to [Open Sauced](https://github.com/open-sauced/open-sauced), which is a site to
manage your future open-source contributions.
